# Website Porfolio & Description

This website will give a detailed description about myself while also expressing my creativity and designs on a website for people to see. It will display my current projects, achievements, and brief information about myself. The main goal for this project is to have a great place to record and show people information about myself as this can be used for future use.

# Implementation
There are two parts that this site will be developed:
- Tailwind CSS and HTML
- Regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The tailwindcss will be prioritized as that was the main thing i was going for in this portfolio project and the regular html, css, and javascript were mainly used for brainstorming purposes and designing so in combination with the wireframe, i would get a better idea on how to fully style my site.

# Using the website
The tailwind should already be available as it was imported using the play CDN on tailwind's website so no installation is needed, meaning the HTML file and the animation styles in the website should be able to run anywhere and properly.
You can also use my github repository link to access the website if you want to do that instead.
